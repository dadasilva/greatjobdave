## About the Track

"Blue in Green" is one of the most beautiful and contemplative pieces in jazz history. The track features:

- Miles Davis on trumpet
- John Coltrane on tenor saxophone
- Bill Evans on piano
- Paul Chambers on bass
- Jimmy Cobb on drums

The piece is known for its circular structure, with a 10-measure form that creates a dreamlike, floating quality. Bill Evans's piano introduction sets the mood for what becomes an intimate conversation between Davis's muted trumpet and Coltrane's tenor saxophone.

## Historical Context

Recorded on April 22, 1959, at Columbia's 30th Street Studio in New York City, "Blue in Green" represents the pinnacle of modal jazz. While the composition is credited to Miles Davis, pianist Bill Evans claimed he wrote the piece, with Davis contributing to its development.

The track's influence extends beyond jazz, inspiring musicians across genres with its:
- Innovative harmonic structure
- Emotional depth
- Minimalist approach
- Atmospheric qualities
