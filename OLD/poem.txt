He is perched in the doorway smoking a cigarette
His house sways with the wind
He can hear a distant cat bellow to be let inside
A distant chime cracks near the window of a sleeping widow
And the sky shares the stories of the ocean

Once this was all sea
Our former selves mulled about within the consciousness of God
We cracked within waves near the window of a fatherless son
And a wind carried his thoughts to shore

Once upon land the brush of the sea
Made advances to the sky as it only knew days ago within the sea
Their mouths gaping and scorched from the star above learned yet what it meant to be apart from home

Set apart from all this stood a man without clothes resisting his urge to die
And he heard the wind tell the stories of the ocean
And he made advances in the darkness
To find the fire
And he remembered the sound of the cat bellowing to be let inside
It was cast amongst the marching cleats of rail cars
